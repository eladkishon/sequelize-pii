<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About 


In many cases some models in your database will have private identifiable information.
For example, a user's email address, name, address etc.

Sequelize is missing a good support of defining some fields of your
project as PII while maintaining a convenient declarative syntax.
